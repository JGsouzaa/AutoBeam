That's a software developed in my Master's Degree on the Civil Engineering Field that allows user to automatizate the calculation of a reinforcement concrete beam using the Robot Structural Analysis API.

Also this software provides the user the option to "optmize" the beam design using the decalation of momentum diagram technique on the Eurocode 2 to get a better result, without the user needs to think and make further calculations, only needed the decision making from part of the user.

main -> contains all program

mf is for function module 
mr is for reference module

need to clean and refine the main code
